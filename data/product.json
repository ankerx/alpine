  "material": "Mad Dog goat sits in the sweet spot of classic style and sturdy substance. The iconic leather has high tensile strength, abrasion resistance, and a natural softness. Oils and waxes used in the tanning process bring out the leatherâ€™s distinctive grain and allow scratches and scuffs to blend in. In time, this leather lightens in some places and burnishes in others for a covetable vintage patina.",
  "care": "Clean: Remove loose dust or dirt with damp cloth or soft brush. For heavily soiled products use Lucchese Leather Cleaner (see care instructions) Condition: Apply Lucchese Leather Conditioner to your boots liberally, let dry. Polish: Apply neutral or color matching cream-based polish and buff with a soft cloth to a shine. Protect: Apply Lucchese Premium Leather Protector."
